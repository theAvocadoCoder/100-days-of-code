# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: August 19, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I worked a little on the createElement function of avocadohelpers

**Thoughts** I am currently struggling with how to type one of the parameters for the function. I think there might be a way to do this which is beyond my current understanding so tomorrow I will attempt switching tactics.

### Day 2: August 20, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I figured out how to type the parameter I had trouble with. I started working on the function. I learned a bit more about Typescript in the process.
2. I had an interview with a Creator Sponsor User for Avi. It was insightful: I learned about the post-production process and I realized there is another user to pay attention to. Curators. Similar to the Creator User in that they also make content, but are more closely related to the Consumer User in that they consume more content to create.

**Thoughts**:
1. I am observing that a good deal of my time is being spent researching things and figuring things out. I am feeling more confident about my process as I go so that's a good thing.
2. I will need to find a TypeScript roadmap or curriculum so I can have some guidance as I peruse the docs.

### Day 3: August 21, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
1. I worked on my DOM utility functions.
2. The createElement function's option parameter has a property, attributes. The type of this attribute was pretty convoluted so I refactored to simplify it. I finished implementing the createElement function that creates a new element with attributes, styles and children.
3. I modified the style function so that rather than adding the styles to the element's inline styles, it accepts a stylesheet or creates a new one if absent. If no stylesheet is passed, it creates a style element and returns the element's generated id.

### Day 6: August 24, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
1. I solved the FCC roman numeral converter project


### Day 7: August 25th, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
1. I started working on the daily bingo app. So far I'm just doing basic config stuff.

**Thoughts**:
1. Haven't touched Vue in a while and I've never used Nuxt so I'm enjoying the learning as I go. This feels like I will be out of my comfort zone for most of the project, which is fitting since it is supposed to be a challenge.
