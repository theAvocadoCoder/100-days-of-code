# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: August 19, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I worked a little on the createElement function of avocadohelpers

**Thoughts** I am currently struggling with how to type one of the parameters for the function. I think there might be a way to do this which is beyond my current understanding so tomorrow I will attempt switching tactics.
